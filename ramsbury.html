<h2>The Village</h2>
<p>
  <a href="http://www.ramsbury.org">Ramsbury</a> is a thriving village on the Kennet River, 5 miles
  from both Hungerford
  and Marlborough, 10 miles from Swindon and convenient for visiting the Avebury Stones, Crop
  Circles, Stonehenge,
  Marlborough Summer School and Jazz Festival, Newbury Races, The Watermill Theatre and Newbury
  Festival.
  Lambourn, home to many well-known race-horses and their trainers is close by.

  The village has five floodlit tennis courts, two soccer pitches, a cricket pitch, bowling green, a
  general store, a post office, fire station, modern surgery and two pubs which serve food every day
  of the week. Buses go to Marlborough, Swindon and Hungerford but guests can arrange to be
  collected from Hungerford train station or dropped off/picked up from the Ridgeway , a wonderful
  long walk along the hills.

  Ramsbury Brewery was started two years ago so we even have our own, very good beer!
