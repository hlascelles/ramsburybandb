      <p>33 High Street is a terraced cottage in the heart of the pretty Wiltshire village of
        Ramsbury.
      </p>

      <p>
        The house is virtually opposite Holy Cross Church and the Memorial Hall, 100 yards from
        <a href="http://www.thebellramsbury.com">The Bell Pub</a>, and 200 yards from
        <a href="https://www.crownandanchorramsbury.co.uk/">The Crown and Anchor</a>, so very
        convenient for any functions at these venues.
