<h2>Rooms</h2>
<p>
  There are two bedrooms to let (two more are sometimes available). One has a double bed, the other
  a double and a single bed; both have their own bathrooms with baths and showers. There are radios,
  hairdryers and all the usual facilities in both the rooms and washing machines, tumble dryers and
  irons are available if needed. Most of the breakfast china, the bed linen and tablecloths are
  designed by my sister-in-law, <a href="http://www.susiewatsondesigns.co.uk">Susie
  Watson</a>, who lives and
  works in the next village, Axford.

<h2>The House</h2>
<p>
  It was built in the early 19th century and has a pretty garden going down to the mill stream. It
  is filled with old family furniture, books and games and guests are free to sit downstairs to
  watch television or read in front of the fire. They are welcome to sit in the garden and use the
  barbeque.
</p>
<p>
  There is a resident, lively Jack Russell - Patch - who is harmless but welcomes people
  enthusiastically.

<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>
  There are many activities available locally, some of which I can help arrange; horseriding and
  fishing, golf, tennis and swimming, and wonderful walking and bicycling. Bicycles can be borrowed
  from the house and walkers dropped off and picked up from various locations.
